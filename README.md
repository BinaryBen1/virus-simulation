## Collision handling and infection spread

When a collision between two shapes occurs, the PyMunk simulator first calls a pre_solve function (in our case the custom collision_begin function).
We check that the two participating shapes in the collision are both people (a collision could also be a person colliding with a wall). If one of the two participants is infected, and the other one isn't, the infection status will be shared with a infection probability p (currently `0.3`).

## Train schedule

The train follows a simple loop. In each cycle it drives from the top to the bottom of the map and then respawns at the top.
Each cycle takes __36k pygame-timesteps__ to complete and contains the following events, __relative to
the start of the cycle__ (i.e. 9k steps means start time $t_{\text{start}}$ of the cycle + 9k timesteps).

| Timestep | Event |
| ------ | ------ |
| $t_{start}$ | The train drives from the top of the map towards the bottom of the map with a velocity $v_x = -1.1 \text{ px/s}$ and $v_y = 30 \text{ px/s}$. |
| $t_{start} + 9k$ | The train stops at the trainstation (velocity is set to 0) and opens the door. |
| $t_{start} + 13k$ | The train closes it's door and resumes moving with the initial velocity of $v_x = -1.1 \text{ px/s}$ and $v_y = 30 \text{ px/s}$. |
| $t_{start} + 36k$ | The train respawns at the top of the map at $x = 70$ and $y = 5$. |
